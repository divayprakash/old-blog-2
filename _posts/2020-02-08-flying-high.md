So, my first post. Here goes.......

I am writing this while 30,000 feet in the air on board a Boeing 737-85R, travelling from Mumbai to Guwahati. I had to being that up because it'd give me an opportunity to talk about my love of flying. I never thought of pursuing it as a career option, and flying for fun was just out of the question for me. Yet there is something about flying that just captures my imagination like nothing else (well, with the exception of cars, but I'll probably talk about it some time later so we can leave that for now). Anyhow, suffice it to say that I really enjoy flying. I've only travelled on narrowbodies for now, but I hope to change that soon. Come on the Indian government, keep Air India alive for 4 more months so I can catch a B747. The Queen is the widebody that I want to experience the first (no puns intended!).

I don't know whether it's the sights, the sounds, or the technical and engineering marvel that amazes me the most. I'd say its a combination of all of those factors. However, I feel the most important thing is the freedom. Not freedom in the sense that an airplane gives you literal wings to travel anywhere, there's no scope for that on commercial flights. No, what I mean is the freedom from the rest of the world. Develop a thick-enough skin that you can shrug off the person sitting next to you, and flying becomes an absolute joy. No one can reach you. No one can disturb you. It's the time my imagination is as its most active, painting pictures in the sky and clouds. An endless string of emergencies can happen on the ground and I can be blissfully unaware of them. Don't confuse this for my being a selfish a\*\*hole, but sometimes I think it's one of the simplest joys of 21st century life to just take a step back from it all. Switch off your phones, turn down the lights and give space to all the thoughts that run through your head.

But enough for now, I have a connecting flight to catch and the clouds are beckoning.

Ciao!
