As I said before, I type this now on my connecting flight, now on a Bombardier Q400NG Bash 8 bound for Dibrugarh. This really is one aircraft I love flying on. Somehow (and I really don't actually know how) it turns out that these are far more comfortable as compared to regular jet aircraft in India like the A320s or the B737s. There is loads more legroom, and the seats are more comfortable. The noise is noticeably more of course, but that's to be expected with a propeller. However, some noise cancellation headphones sort that right out.

The plane also flies at a lower altitude all through the flight, meaning that you can see so much more! And on a clear day like today is, I can see clear till the ground, which feels really special. Even at cruising altitude, I am enjoying sceneic views from the comfort of my seat, sipping on a capucinno.

Yes, this may not seem like much, but lately I've found myself finding joy in the smallest of things. I did make a conscious effort to be more mindful of my surroundings, but I didn't think I'd see results so early. Just goes to show the importance of enjoying the litte things!
